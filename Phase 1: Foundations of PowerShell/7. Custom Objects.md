### 🎉 **PowerShell Custom Objects: The Adventure Begins!** 🎉

Custom objects in PowerShell are like creating your own magical creatures. You can define their properties (like a creature’s abilities) and methods (their special moves). 

Let’s dive into the world of PowerShell custom objects, making it fun, educational, and interactive! 🧙‍♂️

## 🏗️ **Creating Custom Objects: The Blueprint** 🏗️

A **custom object** is like designing your own superhero. You can define their traits (properties) and abilities (methods) that make them unique.

### Step 1: Use `[PSCustomObject]` to Create Your Hero
```powershell
$hero = [PSCustomObject]@{
    Name = "PowerShell Master"
    Power = "Script Summoning"
    Strength = 100
}
```

Here, we’ve created a **hero** with a name, power, and strength!

### 🛠️ **Exercise 1: Design Your Own Hero**
Design a custom object representing your own superhero. Define three properties: `Name`, `Power`, and `Speed`.

```powershell
# Create your superhero
# Add your hero's name, power, and speed
```

---

## 🌟 **Adding and Modifying Properties** 🌟

Heroes can evolve! Let’s add more traits or change existing ones.

### Adding New Properties:
You can modify your custom object on the fly!

```powershell
$hero.Agility = 85
```

### Changing an Existing Property:
```powershell
$hero.Power = "Advanced Scripting"
```

Now your **hero** is getting even stronger! 💪

### 🛠️ **Exercise 2: Power Up Your Hero**
Add a new property called `Weapon` and modify the existing `Power` to make your superhero even more formidable!

```powershell
# Add Weapon property and change Power

```

---

## 🧙 **Custom Methods: Special Moves for Your Object** 🧙

Want your superhero to perform actions? Let’s add a method—a function your object can perform.

```powershell
$hero = [PSCustomObject]@{
    Name = "PowerShell Master"
    Power = "Script Summoning"
    PerformMove = { 
        param($move) 
        "Hero performs $move!" 
    }
}

# Call the method
$hero.PerformMove("Power Kick")
```

Now your hero can perform moves on command! 🦸‍♂️

### 🛠️ **Exercise 3: Add a Signature Move**
Give your superhero a custom method called `SignatureMove`, and make it print a message with the hero’s signature attack!

```powershell
# Create method for your superhero's signature move

# Perform the signature move
```

---

## 📋 **Managing Custom Objects in Collections** 📋

What’s better than one superhero? A whole **team**! You can store multiple custom objects in an array or list.

```powershell
$heroes = @()
$heroes += [PSCustomObject]@{ Name = "SuperCoder"; Power = "Infinite Loop"; Speed = 200 }
$heroes += [PSCustomObject]@{ Name = "Debugger"; Power = "Code Cleanse"; Speed = 150 }
```

Now you’ve got a **team** of heroes ready to fight bugs together!

### 🛠️ **Exercise 4: Build Your Own Hero Team**
Create a team of three superheroes, each with their own unique powers and traits. Store them in an array and print the whole team!

```powershell
# Create your superhero team

```
