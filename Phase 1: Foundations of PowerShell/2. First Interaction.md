# **First Interaction with PowerShell**

### **1. Download PowerShell**

- **Windows:**
  - PowerShell is pre-installed on most Windows operating systems (version 5.1 or lower).
  - To download the latest version of PowerShell (PowerShell 7 or higher), visit the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.4.5) or [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store).
  - Installation steps:
    1. Go to the [PowerShell releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases).
    2. Download the `.msi` installer for your Windows version (x64/x86).
    3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

- **macOS/Linux:**
  - PowerShell is also available for macOS and various Linux distributions.
  - You can install it via package managers (e.g., Homebrew for macOS, APT for Ubuntu).
  - Example for macOS using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install --cask powershell
    ```
  - Example for Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y wget apt-transport-https software-properties-common
    wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
    sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y powershell
    ```

### **2. Method of Interaction**

- **PowerShell Console:**
  - Launch the PowerShell application (`powershell.exe` for Windows, `pwsh` for macOS/Linux).
  - This is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) where you can execute commands and scripts directly.

- **Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE):**
  - Windows PowerShell ISE provides a GUI-based interface where you can write, test, and debug PowerShell scripts.
  - It offers features like syntax highlighting and IntelliSense.
  - To open it, search for "Windows PowerShell ISE" in the Start menu.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
  - A widely-used code editor with a PowerShell extension available.
  - It supports advanced features like debugging, script analysis, and Git integration.

### **3. Command Syntax**

- **Cmdlets:**
  - PowerShell commands are known as cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets").
  - Cmdlets follow a `Verb-Noun` naming convention.
  - Example:
    ```powershell
    Get-Process    # Retrieves a list of processes running on the local machine.
    Start-Service  # Starts a service.
    Stop-Computer  # Shuts down the local computer.
    ```

- **Parameters:**
  - Cmdlets often require parameters to specify what action to perform or on which object.
  - Parameters can be named or positional.
  - Example:
    ```powershell
    Get-Process -Name "notepad"
    ```

- **Pipelines:**
  - PowerShell uses pipelines (`|`) to pass the output of one cmdlet as input to another.
  - Example:
    ```powershell
    Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 100 }
    ```

### **4. Two Cmdlets to Master Every Cmdlet in PowerShell**
To master every cmdlet in PowerShell, the two essential cmdlets you should be familiar with are:

#### I. **`Get-Command`**
   - **Purpose:** `Get-Command` is the go-to cmdlet for discovering what commands are available in PowerShell. It lists all cmdlets, functions, workflows, aliases, and scripts that you can execute in your session.

   - **Basic Usage:**
     ```powershell
     Get-Command
     ```
     This command will return a list of all available commands in your session.

   - **Filter by Command Type:**
     - If you want to see only cmdlets:
       ```powershell
       Get-Command -CommandType Cmdlet
       ```
     - If you are looking for functions or aliases:
       ```powershell
       Get-Command -CommandType Function
       Get-Command -CommandType Alias
       ```

   - **Search by Name:**
     - To find a cmdlet when you know part of its name:
       ```powershell
       Get-Command -Name *Process*
       ```
       This will list all commands with "Process" in their names.

#### II. **`Get-Help`**
   - **Purpose:** `Get-Help` provides detailed information about cmdlets, including their syntax, parameters, examples, and descriptions. It’s crucial for understanding how to use any cmdlet properly.

   - **Basic Usage:**
     ```powershell
     Get-Help <Cmdlet-Name>
     ```
     Replace `<Cmdlet-Name>` with the name of the cmdlet you want to learn about. For example:
     ```powershell
     Get-Help Get-Process
     ```

   - **Examples:**
     - To see examples of how to use a cmdlet:
       ```powershell
       Get-Help Get-Process -Examples
       ```
     - To get detailed information (including parameter descriptions):
       ```powershell
       Get-Help Get-Process -Detailed
       ```
     - To see the full technical documentation:
       ```powershell
       Get-Help Get-Process -Full
       ```

   - **Update Help Files:**
     - You can update the help content to the latest version:
       ```powershell
       Update-Help
       ```

By mastering `Get-Command` and `Get-Help`, you gain the ability to explore and learn about every cmdlet available in PowerShell, making them indispensable tools for both beginners and advanced users.


### **5. Aliases**

- **Understanding Aliases:**
  - Aliases are shortcuts or alternate names for cmdlets.
  - They are primarily used for convenience, especially for users familiar with other shells like Command Prompt or Unix shells.

- **Common Aliases:**
  - `ls` → `Get-ChildItem`
  - `cd` → `Set-Location`
  - `dir` → `Get-ChildItem`
  - `pwd` → `Get-Location`
  - `cp` → `Copy-Item`
  - `mv` → `Move-Item`
  - `rm` → `Remove-Item`

- **Managing Aliases:**
  - `Get-Alias`: Lists all current aliases.
  - `Set-Alias`: Creates a new alias.
  - `Remove-Item`: Deletes an alias.
  - Example:
    ```powershell
    Set-Alias ll Get-ChildItem
    ```
