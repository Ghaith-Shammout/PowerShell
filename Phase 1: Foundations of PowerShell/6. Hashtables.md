# 🎩 **Unlocking the Magic of Hashtables in PowerShell** 🎩

Imagine a **hashtable** as your personal filing cabinet. Instead of rummaging through endless data, you have **keys** to quickly access exactly what you need. No more hunting—just instant results! Think of it as your **PowerShell vault** where each key unlocks a treasure chest of information.

## 💡 **Why Hashtables Are Your Best Friend** 💡

Hashtables allow you to bundle related data into neat little packages, where each **key** gives you instant access to its paired **value**. They’re essential when dealing with data structures that need to be retrieved at lightning speed ⚡—whether you're organizing configuration settings or managing data from an external source like a CSV.

## 🏗️ **Building Your Hashtable** 🏗️

Hashtables are built with key-value pairs, much like organizing your desk with labels for quick access. The **key** is your label, and the **value** is what’s in the drawer. Each entry is simple:  
**`Key = Value`**  
Don’t worry—PowerShell makes sure the keys are unique so you don't accidentally lose track of anything.

### Syntax to declare a hashtable:
```powershell
$hashtable = @{
    Name = 'Alice'
    Age = 26
    FavoriteColor = 'Blue'
}
```

Here, `Name`, `Age`, and `FavoriteColor` are keys. Now, you’ve got a mini bio of Alice stored efficiently!

### 🎯 **Exercise 1: Build Your Bio** 🎯

Time to create your own character! Build a hashtable with:
- Name
- Age
- Favorite Food

Then print the hashtable to the console. Let your creativity flow! 🧑‍🎨

```powershell
# Your code here to build an awesome character bio
```

## 🛠️ **Adding and Removing Items: Mix & Match** 🛠️

Need to add more info? It’s as simple as opening a drawer and tossing in new items! 🏗️ Here’s how you add or remove items from your hashtable:

#### Adding a new item:
```powershell
$hashtable['Hobby'] = 'Painting'
```

#### Removing an item:
```powershell
$hashtable.Remove('Age')
```

#### Clear everything (hashtag start fresh):
```powershell
$hashtable.Clear()
```

---

### 🚀 **Exercise 2: Power Up Your Bio** 🚀

- Add a **Hobby** key to your character bio.
- Remove the **Age** key—who needs numbers anyway? 🎉

```powershell
# Add a cool hobby and remove the age
# Your code here
```

---

## 🔍 **Accessing Your Hashtable: What’s in the Drawer?** 🔍

Want to peek inside and see what’s stored under a key? Just use the key to get the value, like opening your drawer to find that secret snack stash 🍫!

```powershell
$hashtable['Name']
```

If the key doesn’t exist, you get **$null**—it’s like opening an empty drawer. 🎃

---

### 🧐 **Exercise 3: What’s Your Name?** 🧐

Retrieve and display the **name** from the hashtable you created earlier. Let’s see if you’ve built your bio correctly!

```powershell
# Get the name key value!
# Your code here
```

## ⚙️ **Useful Hashtable Superpowers** ⚙️

Hashtables aren’t just about storing things—they come packed with built-in superpowers to help you manage them like a pro! 🦸‍♂️

- **Keys**: Get a list of all the keys in your hashtable (your labels):
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.Keys
    ```

- **Values**: Peek at all the goodies (values) stored inside:
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.Values
    ```

- **Count**: Count how many key-value pairs you’ve stored:
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.Count
    ```

---

### 🧠 **Exercise 4: Inventory Check!** 🧠

Use the `Keys` and `Values` methods to list all the keys and values in your hashtable. Do a quick count—how much data have you stored?

```powershell
# Time to check what's inside!
# Your code here
```

---

## 🔎 **Is It in the Vault? Checking for Keys and Values** 🔎

Before you start searching for something, it's always good to check if it's there first! Use these nifty commands to see if your hashtable contains a certain key or value. 🗝️

- **Check if a key exists**:
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.ContainsKey('FavoriteColor')
    ```

- **Check if a value exists**:
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.ContainsValue('Blue')
    ```

---

### 🕵️ **Exercise 5: Key Detective** 🕵️

Check if the **favorite color** key exists in your hashtable. Then, see if your favorite color is in there too! 🎨

```powershell
# Be a key detective! 🔎
# Your code here
```
