## Introduction to Hashtables in PowerShell

A **hashtable** in PowerShell is a collection of key-value pairs, much like dictionaries in other programming languages. Hashtables allow you to quickly look up data based on a unique key. They’re a fundamental part of PowerShell scripting, making it easier to store, manage, and retrieve complex data structures efficiently. They are widely used because of their simplicity and speed when it comes to operations like lookups and updates.

### Why are they important?
Hashtables give you flexibility to group related data and retrieve it instantly. For example, you can use them for configuration settings, storing data from external sources (like a CSV file), or even passing around multiple pieces of data in a more organized way.

### Structure and Declaration of Hashtables

Hashtables in PowerShell use a simple structure: each entry has a **key** and a **value**, separated by an equals sign (`=`). The key is a unique identifier, while the value is the data you want to associate with that key. Keys are case-insensitive by default and should be unique within a hashtable.

#### Syntax to declare a hashtable:
```powershell
$hashtable = @{
    Key1 = 'Value1'
    Key2 = 'Value2'
    Key3 = 'Value3'
}
```

Here, `Key1`, `Key2`, and `Key3` are keys, and each has an associated value.

#### Exercise 1: 
Declare a hashtable that contains information about a fictional person, including their name, age, and favorite color. Display the hashtable to the console.
```powershell
# Your Code here
```

### Adding and Removing Items from Hashtables

You can add new items to an existing hashtable by specifying a new key and its value.

#### Adding an item:
```powershell
$hashtable['NewKey'] = 'NewValue'
```

To remove an item, you can use the `Remove()` method.

#### Removing an item:
```powershell
$hashtable.Remove('KeyToRemove')
```

You can also remove all items using the `Clear()` method:
```powershell
$hashtable.Clear()
```

#### Exercise 2:
- Add a new key-value pair to the hashtable from the first exercise (e.g., add a "Hobby" key).
- Then remove the "age" key from the hashtable.

```powershell
# Your code here

```
---

### Accessing Items in Hashtables

Once you have a hashtable, you can access values using their corresponding keys:
```powershell
$hashtable['Key1']
```

This returns the value associated with `Key1`. If the key doesn’t exist, it returns `$null`.

#### Exercise 3:
Retrieve the value of the "name" key from the hashtable you created earlier.

```powershell
# Your code here

```

### Useful Methods and Properties

Hashtables come with several built-in methods and properties that make working with them easier.

- **Keys**: Returns all the keys in the hashtable.
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.Keys
    ```

- **Values**: Returns all the values in the hashtable.
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.Values
    ```

- **Count**: Displays the number of key-value pairs in the hashtable.
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.Count
    ```

#### Exercise 4:
Use the `Keys` and `Values` properties to display all the keys and values from your hashtable.
```powershell
# Your code here

```

### Checking for Existence of a Key or Value

To see if a hashtable contains a particular key or value, you can use the `ContainsKey()` and `ContainsValue()` methods.

- **Check for a key**:
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.ContainsKey('KeyToCheck')
    ```

- **Check for a value**:
    ```powershell
    $hashtable.ContainsValue('ValueToCheck')
    ```

#### Exercise 5:
Check if the "favorite color" key exists in your hashtable, and verify if the hashtable contains a specific color value (choose a value from your own data).
```powershell
# Your code here

```
