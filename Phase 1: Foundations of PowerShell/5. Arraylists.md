# Introduction to ArrayLists in PowerShell

While arrays are powerful, they have limitations, especially when it comes to resizing. Enter the **ArrayList**—a more flexible collection type. An ArrayList is a class in the .NET framework that provides dynamic resizing, making it more suitable for scenarios where the size of the collection is expected to change frequently.

## Declaring an ArrayList

To create an ArrayList, you need to use the `System.Collections.ArrayList` class.

```powershell
# Create an ArrayList of integers
$integerArrayList=[System.Collections.ArrayList]@(1, 2, 3)

# Create an ArrayList of Strings
$stringArrayList=[System.Collections.ArrayList]@("Item1", "Item2", "Item3")
```
### Exercise 1: ArrayList Creation
1. Create an ArrayList containing three different types of fruits.
```powershell
# Your Code here 
```


## Manipulating an ArrayList
Unlike arrays, you can directly add, remove, or insert elements into an ArrayList without creating a new one.

```powershell
# Adding elements
$integerArrayList.Add(4)

# Removing an element
$integerArrayList.Remove(2)

# Inserting an element at a specific position
$stringArrayList.Insert(1, "New Item")
```

#### Benefits of Using ArrayLists
1. **Dynamic Resizing:** Unlike arrays, ArrayLists automatically resize themselves.
2. **Flexible Data Storage:** You can store different data types in the same ArrayList.
3. **Built-in Methods:** ArrayLists come with useful methods like `.Add()`, `.Remove()`, and `.Insert()` for easier manipulation.

### Exercise 2: ArrayList Manipulation
1. Create an ArrayList containing three different types of fruits.
2. Add two more fruits to the list.
3. Remove one fruit
4. Insert a new fruit at index 1.
5. Print the final list.

```powershell
# Create fruit arraylist
# Your code here

# Add two fruits of your favorites
# Your code here

# Remove one fruit form the list
# Your code here

# Insert a new fruit at index 1
# Your code here

# Print the arraylist
# Your code here
```

### Useful Methods and Properties of ArrayLists

Here are some common methods and properties you’ll frequently use with ArrayLists:

- **Add()**: Adds an element to the ArrayList.
- **Remove()**: Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
- **Insert()**: Inserts an element at the specified index.
- **Count**: Gets the number of elements in the ArrayList.
- **Contains()**: Checks if a specific element is in the ArrayList.
- **Sort()**: Sorts the ArrayList in ascending order.

Example:
```powershell
$integerArrayList.Sort()
```

### Exercise 3: Exploring ArrayList Methods
1. Create an ArrayList of random numbers.
2. Sort the numbers using the `.Sort()` method.
3. Check if the number '1' number exists in the list using the `.Contains()` method.
4. Print the count of numbers in the ArrayList.
```powershell
# Create an arraylist of random  numbers
# Your code here

# Sort the arraylist
# Your code here

# Check number `1`
# Your code here

# Print the total number of items in the arraylist
# Your code here
```

### Arrays vs. ArrayLists in PowerShell 7

Although both Arrays and ArrayLists serve the purpose of storing collections, they have some important differences:

| **Feature**            | **Array**                    | **ArrayList**                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Size**               | Fixed                         | Dynamic (resizable)                        |
| **Type**               | Homogeneous or heterogeneous  | Heterogeneous (can store different types)  |
| **Performance**        | Faster for fixed collections  | Slower, but flexible for dynamic resizing  |
| **Methods/Properties** | Limited                       | Rich with methods for easier manipulation  |

**When to Use Arrays:**
- Use an array if you know the size of your collection won’t change.
- Arrays are faster and simpler when working with a fixed set of elements.

**When to Use ArrayLists:**
- Use an ArrayList if the size of your collection might change.
- ArrayLists offer more built-in functionality for manipulating dynamic collections.

### Advanced Section: Multidimensional Arrays

In PowerShell, you can also create multidimensional arrays, useful for representing data in table-like formats.

#### Declaring a Multidimensional Array

```powershell
# 2x2 matrix (2 rows, 2 columns)
$matrix = @( @(1, 2), @(3, 4) )

# Accessing an element
$element = $matrix[1][1]  # Output: 4
```

Multidimensional arrays allow you to model data in grids or matrices, and can be helpful in mathematical operations or data analysis tasks.

### Exercise 4: Multidimensional Arrays
1. Create a 3x3 matrix representing a tic-tac-toe board.
2. Access and print the center element of the matrix.
3. Change a value on the board and print the updated matrix.

```powershell
# Create 3x3 matrix
# Your code here

# Print the center element
# Your code here

# Change an item on the board and print its value
# Your code here


```
