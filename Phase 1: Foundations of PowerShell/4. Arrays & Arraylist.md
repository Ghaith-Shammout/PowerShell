# Introduction to Arrays in PowerShell 

## What Are Arrays in PowerShell?

In PowerShell, an array is a data structure that holds a collection of values, much like a list. These values can be of any data type, including integers, strings, or even other arrays. Think of an array as a storage container where you can keep multiple items, all in a specific order, and you can access each item by its position (index) in the array.

### Example:
```powershell
# Creating an array of numbers
$numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# Creating an array of strings
$fruits = "Apple", "Banana", "Orange"

# Another method to create an array
$fruitsArray = @("Apple", "Banana", "Orange")
```

### Exercise:
Create an array of your favorite movies and store them in a variable called `$movies`. Display the contents of the array.

```powershell
$movies = # Add your favorite movies here

# Print the array
$movies
```

## Benefits of Using Arrays

Arrays are incredibly useful when you need to work with collections of data. Here are a few benefits:

1. **Organization**: Arrays help you keep related data together in one place.
2. **Efficiency**: You can perform operations on multiple items simultaneously, such as sorting or filtering.
3. **Scalability**: Arrays can grow or shrink in size dynamically, which means you can easily add or remove items.




## Manipulating Arrays
PowerShell makes it easy to manipulate arrays. Here are some common operations:

### Accessing Items
You can access items in an array using their index, which starts at 0.

```powershell
$firstFruit = $fruits[0]  # Gets the first item
```

### Exercise:
Use the movie array created from the previous exercise to print the last item in the array. 
Tips! Arrays store items with ordered indexes starting from 0. 
```powershell
$movies[# Your code here]
```

### Adding Items
You can add items to an array using the `+` operator.

Method 1: 
```powershell
$fruits=$fruits+"Kiwi"
```

Method 2: 
```powershell
$fruits += "Grape"
```

### Exercise:
Add the movie _Interstellar_ to your collection using your favourite method.
Tips! Do not forget to add quotes to your string

```powershell
# Your code here
```

### Removing Items
There are two methods to remove an item from an array 
#### Remove using `-replace` operator 
To remove an item, use the `-replace` operator combined with the item you want to remove.
This method is helpful when you know the name of the item that you want to remove from the list.
```powershell
$fruits = $fruits -replace "Banana"
```
#### Remove using quote brackets []
To remove an item at a specific index, you can use quote brackets with the index of the item you want to delete. 
Here, we use the `-ne` which is a comparison operator that stands for "not equal." (more about comparison operators later on) making the newly created array without the specified item.

```powershell
$fruits = $fruits -ne $fruits[0]
```

### Exercise:
Using your favorite method of removing items from an array, remove the first item in your _movie_ array. 
```powershell
# Your code here
```


### Exercise:
Start with an array of your favorite colors. Add two more colors to the array and then remove one. Finally, display the updated array.

```powershell
# Create colors array
$colors = # Your code here

# Add two more colors
$colors += # Your code here

# Remove one color
$colors = # Your code here

# Print the array 
$colors
```

## Useful Methods and Properties

Arrays in PowerShell come with several useful methods and properties that make it easy to work with them.

### `.Count`
The `.Count` property returns the number of items in the array.

```powershell
$numberOfFruits = $fruits.Count
```

### `.Contains()`
The `.Contains()` method checks if a specific item exists in the array.

```powershell
$containsApple = $fruits.Contains("Apple")  # Returns True or False
```

### `.Sort()`
The `.Sort()` method sorts the array in ascending order.

```powershell
$numbers = 5, 3, 1, 4, 2
$numbers = $numbers.Sort()
```

### Exercise:
Create an array of random numbers. Sort the array and then check if a specific number is present in the array.

```powershell
# Create an array of random numbers
$randomNumbers = # Your code here

# Sort the array 
$sortedNumbers = # Your code here

# Print the array
$sortedNumbers

# Check if a specific number is in the array
$sortedNumbers.# Your code here
```

## Multi-Dimensional Arrays

PowerShell also supports multi-dimensional arrays, which are arrays within arrays. This is useful when you need to represent data in a grid or table format.

### Example:
```powershell
# Creating a 2x2 multi-dimensional array
$matrix = @(
    @(1, 2),
    @(3, 4)
)

# Accessing an item in a multi-dimensional array
$item = $matrix[0][1]  # Gets the second item of the first array
```

### Exercise:
Create a 3x3 multi-dimensional array representing a tic-tac-toe board. Access and print the value in the center of the board.

```powershell
# Your code here
$board = @(
    @("X", "O", "X"),
    @("O", "X", "O"),
    @("X", "O", "X")
)

$centerValue = $board[1][1]  # The center of the board
$centerValue
```

## Conclusion

Arrays are a powerful feature in PowerShell 7, allowing you to store and manipulate collections of data with ease. Whether youâ€™re sorting a list, checking for specific values, or organizing your data, arrays provide a versatile toolset to help you get the job done efficiently.

### Final Exercise:
Combine everything you've learned! Create an array of numbers from 1 to 100. Filter out the numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, sort the remaining numbers, and then display the total count of numbers left in the array.

```powershell
# Your code here
$numbers = 1..100
$filteredNumbers = $numbers | Where-Object { $_ % 3 -ne 0 -and $_ % 5 -ne 0 }
$sortedFilteredNumbers = $filteredNumbers.Sort()
$sortedFilteredNumbers
$sortedFilteredNumbers.Count
```

With this introduction, you should now have a solid foundation for working with arrays in PowerShell 7. Practice these concepts regularly, and soon you'll be leveraging arrays like a pro!
