## Introduction to Conditional Statements in PowerShell 🧠💡

Conditional statements are the decision-makers in your scripts. They allow your program to respond differently based on certain conditions or values. In other words, they help your script answer questions like: "Is this condition true? What should I do next?" 🎯

Without conditional statements, every script would run in a linear, predictable way. But real-world problems aren’t so simple—they require flexibility. Imagine if you couldn’t check if a user input is valid, if today is a weekend, or if a file exists. Conditional statements give your scripts the **intelligence** to make decisions based on the current situation, making your code more **dynamic** and **responsive**.

PowerShell offers several conditional constructs, such as `if`, `elseif`, `else`, and `switch`. Each serves a different purpose, allowing you to control the flow of your program. Whether you're checking numbers, strings, file paths, or even the current weather 🌦️, conditional statements are the core tool that helps you react to changes in data.

By mastering conditional statements, you’ll be able to write smarter, more powerful scripts that can handle a variety of tasks with ease! 💻

### 1. The `if` Statement 🕵️‍♂️

The `if` statement evaluates whether a condition is **true**. If the condition is true, it runs the block of code inside it. Here's the basic structure:

```powershell
if (condition) {
    # Code to run if the condition is true
}
```

For example:

```powershell
$temperature = 30
if ($temperature -gt 25) {
    Write-Host "It's a hot day! ☀️"
}
```

In this example, the script checks if the temperature is greater than 25. If it is, the message "It's a hot day! ☀️" is printed.

#### 🏋️‍♀️ Exercise 1: 
Check if a number is positive, and if it is, print "The number is positive!" 

```powershell
# Task: Check if $number is positive
$number = 10
# Your code here
```

---

### 2. The `else` Statement 🤔

The `else` statement runs a block of code when the `if` condition is **false**. It's like saying, "If this condition isn't true, then do something else."

```powershell
if (condition) {
    # Code to run if true
} else {
    # Code to run if false
}
```

For example:

```powershell
$temperature = 15
if ($temperature -gt 25) {
    Write-Host "It's a hot day! ☀️"
} else {
    Write-Host "It's not that hot. 🌥️"
}
```

If the temperature is not greater than 25, the script will print "It's not that hot. 🌥️".

#### 🏋️‍♂️ Exercise 2: 
Check if a number is negative, and if it is not, print "The number is non-negative!"

```powershell
# Task: Check if $number is negative
$number = -5
# Your code here
```

---

### 3. The `elseif` Statement 🔄

The `elseif` statement allows you to check multiple conditions. If the first `if` condition is false, it checks the next condition.

```powershell
if (condition1) {
    # Code if condition1 is true
} elseif (condition2) {
    # Code if condition2 is true
} else {
    # Code if none of the above are true
}
```

For example:

```powershell
$temperature = 20
if ($temperature -gt 30) {
    Write-Host "It's scorching hot! 🔥"
} elseif ($temperature -gt 20) {
    Write-Host "It's warm. 🌞"
} else {
    Write-Host "It's a bit chilly. ❄️"
}
```

#### 🏋️‍♀️ Exercise 3: 
Check if a number is positive, zero, or negative, and print the appropriate message for each case.

```powershell
# Task: Check if $number is positive, zero, or negative
$number = 0
# Your code here
```

---

### 4. Comparison Operators in Conditions 🔍

In PowerShell, you'll often use comparison operators in your conditions. Here are some common ones:

- `-eq`: Equals
- `-ne`: Not equals
- `-gt`: Greater than
- `-lt`: Less than
- `-ge`: Greater than or equal to
- `-le`: Less than or equal to

Example:

```powershell
$age = 18
if ($age -ge 18) {
    Write-Host "You are an adult. 🎉"
} else {
    Write-Host "You're still a minor. 🧒"
}
```

#### 🏋️‍♂️ Exercise 4: 
Check if a number is even or odd.

```powershell
# Task: Check if $number is even or odd
$number = 7
# Your code here
```

---

### 5. Nesting Conditional Statements 🏗️

You can place `if` statements inside other `if` statements, known as **nesting**. This allows you to create more complex decision-making logic.

Example:

```powershell
$age = 25
$hasID = $true

if ($age -ge 18) {
    if ($hasID) {
        Write-Host "You can enter. ✅"
    } else {
        Write-Host "You need an ID. ❌"
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "You're too young to enter. 🚫"
}
```

#### 🏋️‍♀️ Exercise 5: 
Check if a person can vote (age >= 18), and if they have a valid ID, allow them to vote.

```powershell
# Task: Check if $age is >= 18 and $hasID is true
$age = 20
$hasID = $false
# Your code here
```

---

### 6. The `switch` Statement 🔄

The `switch` statement checks a value against multiple conditions and executes the matching block of code. Here’s the basic syntax:

```powershell
switch (value) {
    case condition1 {
        # Code for condition1
    }
    case condition2 {
        # Code for condition2
    }
    default {
        # Code if no condition matches
    }
}
```

For example, let’s classify days of the week:

```powershell
$day = "Wednesday"

switch ($day) {
    "Monday" { Write-Host "Start of the week! 😅" }
    "Wednesday" { Write-Host "Middle of the week! 🐫" }
    "Friday" { Write-Host "Weekend is almost here! 🎉" }
    default { Write-Host "Just another day! 🌞" }
}
```

In this example, it checks if `$day` matches any of the cases. If it’s `"Wednesday"`, it prints `"Middle of the week! 🐫"`. If none of the conditions match, it runs the `default` case.

---

### 🏋️‍♀️ Exercise 6: 
Use the `switch` statement to check a traffic light color (`Red`, `Yellow`, or `Green`), and print what action should be taken (e.g., stop, slow down, go).

```powershell
# Task: Check the traffic light color and print the corresponding action
$light = "Yellow"
# Your code here
```

---

### 7. Multiple Matches in `switch` 🎯

You can also have multiple matches in the `switch` statement by listing them in the same case block. For instance, if you want to group several days together:

```powershell
$day = "Saturday"

switch ($day) {
    "Saturday" { Write-Host "It's the weekend! 🎉" }
    "Sunday" { Write-Host "It's the weekend! 🎉" }
    default { Write-Host "It's a weekday. 😐" }
}
```

In this case, both `"Saturday"` and `"Sunday"` will print `"It's the weekend! 🎉"`.

---

### 🏋️‍♂️ Exercise 7: 
Create a script that checks the current season (`Spring`, `Summer`, `Autumn`, `Winter`) and prints a fun message for each.

```powershell
# Task: Print a fun message based on the season
$season = "Summer"
# Your code here
```

---

### 8. Handling Multiple Values in `switch` 🎲

You can match multiple values with a single case by using commas to separate them.

```powershell
$fruit = "Apple"

switch ($fruit) {
    "Apple", "Banana", "Orange" {
        Write-Host "You have a fruit! 🍎🍌🍊"
    }
    "Carrot", "Broccoli" {
        Write-Host "You have a vegetable! 🥕🥦"
    }
    default {
        Write-Host "Unknown item! 🤷‍♂️"
    }
}
```

Here, `"Apple"`, `"Banana"`, and `"Orange"` are all treated as the same case, making the `switch` statement more powerful.

---

### 🏋️‍♀️ Exercise 8: 
Check a list of animals, and if it's a cat or dog, print `"Pet"`. If it's a lion or tiger, print `"Wild Animal"`.

```powershell
# Task: Categorize the animal as 'Pet' or 'Wild Animal'
$animal = "Lion"
# Your code here
```

---

### 9. `-Wildcard`, `-Regex`, and `-File` in `switch` 💥

PowerShell’s `switch` statement comes with powerful parameters like `-Wildcard` (for pattern matching) and `-Regex` (for regular expressions).

For example, using `-Wildcard`:

```powershell
$filename = "document.txt"

switch -Wildcard ($filename) {
    "*.txt" { Write-Host "This is a text file. 📄" }
    "*.jpg" { Write-Host "This is an image file. 🖼️" }
    default { Write-Host "Unknown file type. 📁" }
}
```

This checks if the file matches the pattern `"*.txt"` or `"*.jpg"`.

---

### 🏋️‍♂️ Exercise 9: 
Write a `switch` statement that checks a list of file types (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.mp3`) using the `-Wildcard` option.

```powershell
# Task: Check the file type and print an appropriate message
$file = "music.mp3"
# Your code here
```

---

The `switch` statement is super handy for dealing with multiple possible outcomes. It makes your code cleaner, easier to read, and more efficient! 🚀 Keep playing with the exercises, and you'll master conditional logic in PowerShell in no time!
